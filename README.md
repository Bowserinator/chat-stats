# Chat-Stats
A simple python program to analyze chat logs and output pretty HTML charts (Also gives very verbose JSON output). When it's done (It might take a few seconds) you should get an output that looks something like this: https://imgur.com/a/2EYgf

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3 (I used python 3.6)
* A modern web browser to view the HTML file
* (Optional) A screenshot extension, to convert the HTML file into a cool image

### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/Bowserinator/chat-stats
cd chat-stats
```

### Example:
```
python3 examples/example.py
```
See the output folder once the program is done. Feel free to modify example.py for your own chat logs.

## Future TODO
* Generate a PDF of chat logs
* Write some tests
* Publish a pip module
